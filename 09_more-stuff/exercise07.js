// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// Sometimes programs may throw errors at some points during the execution of the program
// resulting in the bugs or unexpected errors. Exception handling is a method to deal with
// errors in a predictable way.
// We surround the block of code that may raise an exception with a try block, and if any exception
// is raised inside the block, the execution jumps to the catch block to deal with the error.
// In summary, program developer can deal with the problem in a predictable way.
